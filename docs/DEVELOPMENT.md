# Development and validation

## Build policy

The initial build task will add CMake presets and exact commands here. The local
environment has CMake, Ninja, MSYS2 MinGW-w64 dependencies, Qt 6, and an NVIDIA GPU.
Do not require a developer-specific absolute dependency path in the portable
project configuration; local paths belong in environment variables or ignored
`CMakeUserPresets.json`.

Build outputs belong under `build/`. Disposable scripts, logs, downloaded inputs,
and test runs belong under `.agents/tmp/<task>/` unless a committed preset or test
harness designates another project-local build output directory. Never build or
write test output into a real game installation or reference asset directory.

## Correctness checks

1. Configure and build the actual executable.
2. Exercise help, game listing, and invalid arguments.
3. Compile a sealed synthetic map through BSP, VIS, and LIGHT.
4. Decompile and recompile fixtures; compare semantic invariants.
5. Test malformed BSP lengths and cross-references.
6. Check scheduling and GPU parity at varied thread/backend settings.
7. Check GUI project serialization, command arguments, queues, and process failures.

Use explicit subprocess timeouts and capture stdout/stderr in test failure reports.
Do not introduce brittle tests that only mirror internal implementation details.
Do not launch a game fullscreen or control input. For any idTech rendering checks,
use only an engine-registered screenshot path; never substitute OS capture.

## Performance evidence

Record compiler revision/build mode, CPU/GPU, worker count, input identity, exact
arguments, elapsed time, and output checksums or semantic comparison results.
Perform warmups and several measured runs. Report median and spread and separate
initialization from steady-state work where useful. Compare against the imported
baseline using the same toolchain and options. Keep deterministic fixture creation
scripts in `tests/` or `benchmarks/`; put generated large data in ignored outputs.

## Commit policy

Complete a coherent task, run its relevant checks, update `docs/PROGRESS.md`, and
commit. Do not bundle unrelated fixes into an optimization commit. Preserve
upstream copyright headers and credit any additional incorporated external code
after checking license compatibility. Record outstanding and unrelated issues.
