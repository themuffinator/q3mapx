# Task log

## 2026-09-29 — Plan and upstream audit

Completed the project plan, architecture, development policy, decompilation design,
and attribution documentation. Verified remote NRC HEAD as
`8216133984031afaa9a857b56ea66dd9c3d54b26` and retrieved that reference source.
Inspected the upstream license and compiler build definitions.

Validation: empty initial repository verified; upstream revision independently
queried and cloned; local build toolchains and dependencies inventoried.

Findings to address:

- NRC creates threads for every parallel pass and serializes each work dispatch
  under the compiler's global lock.
- The active thread implementation has a fixed 64-element array while automatic
  hardware detection is not bounded to that array.
- Decompiler triangle lookup stops at a maximum bound, potentially missing larger
  triangles that still overlap the brush face.
- Upstream uses a monolithic Makefile; a standalone CMake build is needed.

No performance gains or finished GUI/GPU features are claimed at this stage.
Next task: import the required source subset and produce the baseline executable.
